Wonderful,"Ok let me get one thing straight, this phone is not for those guys who wants fancy features like bezel less display, or big screen, or quad camera setup, this just upgraded performance version of 6s, the feature like wireless charging which is not available in most of the flagships available in market is also included.READ MORE",Kuldeep Sharma
Best in the market!,"As being a frequent apple user, I couldn't find much of a difference when comparing to IPhone 6.The size and display are the same of IPhone 6 and ofcourse there is 0 negative comments for the A13 chip. It is super fast✌️.Overall it's the same iPhone 6 with an A13 chip and the generation updates a smartphone can get in 2020.No negative comments for the camera, apple is always the topper in capturing moments and SE2 has got the studio lights, a front facing portrait camera, a wider photo fr...READ MORE",Vishnu Av
Mind-blowing purchase,"This is my first iPhone. A great purchase at this price range. Perfect for a person who wants to buy a new iPhone with the latest iOS and A13 Bionic chipset at a tight budget. Very handy, great camera and flawlessly smooth while switching between apps. Gaming is also awesome thanks to the powerful processor. Battery life could have been better.

A true mid-flagship disrupter has arrived.,"If I could describe this device in a single work it'd be ""Stellar"", it's a bang for buck. Being an apple enthusiast from a long time I took a leap of faith with OnePlus 7, the device was indeed an 'Apple' in the android world, it was a no slouch phone and everything was top notch except the camera and some exclusive apps available on iOS only. My utmost priority to switch back to iPhone was camera and the apps available on the app store plus the unbreakable updates that Apple provides with ti...READ MORE",Raja Arora
Best in this budget,"This is an amazing phone for the price. For someone coming from a pure Android background, migrating data would take a little time, and the battery backup may be quite less for the first 1-2 days. Once it is all set, I felt that the phone gives a decent battery backup. The backup with the ~1800mAh battery on this phone is somewhat comparable to that of an Android with twice the capacity.Camera is amazing for my use, as the lighting and colour tone are Natural, close to what we would see with...READ MORE",Nithin Subhash
Good phone for the price,"Some might say overpriced in India, but below are the PROS and CONS after 3 days of usage:Pros:1. Blazing fast processor. Runs everything thrown at it without a stutter.2. Very good single camera for daylight photography. Night time is good but not great.3. Optimal screen size for a phone for one hand use.4. Brilliant looks5. Battery life is one day when used like a phone. Watch various youtube videos to increase battery life. Optimal use of battery saver mode and screen brightness can...READ MORE",Karn

Just wow!,"I switched from iPhone 8 to iPhone SE instead of going for iPhone 11 since SE comes with same power and great camera with a device size I can easily use and hold in my single hand. I got this delivered within one day of being available in India and it’s just great. I am a big fan of iOS and I’m deep into the Apple ecosystem with my iPad, MacBook, AirPods and an old iPod and I’m not disappointed here too. To those of you who are wondering how is it different from iPhone 8 since it practically ...READ MORE",Neha Singh
Brilliant,"Very handy and comfortable to hold. Best phone to buy if you want sleek design, powerfull processor, beautiful camera and that's fits in your pocket. I didn't hesitate while buying this phone instead of oneplus 8. Afterall its your choice whether you want a phone or a tab sized phone.P.S.- it's not that small.READ MORE",ankit sinha
Great product,Honestly best package from apple. Super handy. I don't like big phones. This phone is perfect for me and would definately recommend to everybody. If you compare antutu and geekbench scores with of iphone 11; this easily beats the iphone 11.READ MORE,Aman Singh

Terrific,"This is my first iPhone. And after using it for 6 continuous days the difference between my previous Sony XZS Android and this iPhone is easily noticeable.  The camera is better in every way. The only thing I miss about my previous phone is the 960 frame/sec super slow motion recording. Performance is way too better than android. This is fast, very very fast. If your eyes are not glued with the screen the battery life is ok. In fact this is the only issue with this phone. This one fits in my ...READ MORE",soham samanta
Unsatisfactory,Everything is fine of this mobile except battery. Battery consumption at 8-10% Brightness inVideo call : almost 4% reduction for every 5-6 mins. Phone call : almost 1% reduction for every 4-5 mins. Which seems to be bit faster consumption. First iPhone I’m using. I’m not sure about regular battery consumption rate. But this doesn’t look nice to me.READ MORE,Prashant Kumar Sharma

Highly recommended,Worth. Take it.READ MORE,prashanth s
Nice product,"Let's face it. The main reason you're even considering this is because you want a compact phone that doesn't compromise on power. Getting OS updates for another 4-5 years, with a decent camera, waterproofing and wireless charging is just an added advantage. There's a few things it could've done better: 1. Battery is barely adequate for a day of moderate usage.2. The bezels could have been reduced to have more screen to body ratio.3. Night mode for the camera was a software feature that ...READ MORE",Saurabh N
The first affordable iPhone,Apple surely delivered a product whose price is finally at-par with other state-of-the-art smartphone brands. The processor and speed are amazing with zero lag. iOS experience is quite pleasing after switching from Android. The external sound is terrific and one of the best a smartphone has to offer. Touch and display are beyond expectations. Overall feel is quite good and the bezels don't really affect much. The only downside is the camera and battery. Both are modest at best. With reasonabl...READ MORE,Kinjal Bhattacharyya

Fair,"Writing this review after around 1 week of use.Pros -      1. Good Camera Quality. Image quality is very good. Pictures are sharp. Good performance in bokeh mode.      2. Good performance. The phone has no lags so far, it is very smooth and fast to use. The response time is less and smooth for all the apps and touch I'd.Cons -      1. Small battery capacity. The battery is really small, for medium users it takes atleast charging it twice in a day. Not a phone for gamers. Battery capaci...READ MORE",Saurabh  Agrawal
Super!,"This is good phone for someone who never used iphone yet but of someone using/used any one of iphone 6 , 7 and/or 8 then there is no much difference between the features except performance. With the provided features the price is too high for this phone. If someone is looking for upgrading then I would strongly suggest you to go for iPhone XS or later versions. This is completely my own opinion and please read other reviews as well before making a decision to purchase this product.READ MORE",Obul Reddy C

Worth the money,"Am not of a Iphone user being this my first Iphone, and earlier I have used Motorola one Power, Redmi 3S Prime and some of the battery efficient android phones, charge doesn’t t last much. Iphone has it’s name over battery inefficiency, so can be ignored. And since I had a screen size specific requirement, I have no regrets. Shifting from Android to IOS, is a bit messy. Overall performance of the phone is decent. I feel I paid hefty for the brand image of Apple.READ MORE",B. Mahesh Rao
Really Nice,"Marking the return of the phone with great performance in a small form factor, this one does make it easy to love it.A well priced proposition with bang for the buck performance and the iOS level of confidence.The battery is only average but that can also be improved if you are a little more aware, than the commonwealth, of the system software customisations.All in all a good phone with a great performance and a decent battery life.READ MORE",Salil Satyadarshi
Brilliant,For ppl who prefer small displays this is the ryt choice neat n clean  top notch performance ......FOR THOSE WHO R CONCERNED ABOUT BATTERY This has 1821mAh battery but combined with a13 chip efficency is top notch . Use 10W charger which comes with ipad or buy separately within 45 mins phone charger from 0-80% The 5w included in box is waste good for nothing. Switch off optimised battery charging under battery health settings so 80-100% will b charged quickly.I use social media apps l...READ MORE,Dhanoop  Krishna

Delightful,"One of the best handsets, very easy to carry & handle. Exceptional performance & amazing display, however battery is the only concern. It consumes more battery when you use internet, especially streaming videos and also while taking pictures. Otherwise everything thing is perfect. People who don’t like to carry big handsets on pocket can definitely go for this. But remember if you play more games or if u r always on internet you might need to carry a fast charger.READ MORE",Srikantan S
Simply awesome,"After using Android phones for last 10 years, this is my 1st iPhone and I am impressed with its performance. Everything is simple and fluidic.At this price, one must not misunderstand this phone as Mid-range, it has A13 chipset same as iPhone 11 Pro, it can be called Classic Flagship as it has given body of iPhone 8.Daylight images are crisp as expected, whereas low light pics are acceptable but not mind blowing as compared to other phones in same price category.For those who sceptical abo...READ MORE",Gaurav Walavalkar

Fabulous!,My first hands-on experience on Apple product.- I am happy with the dual SIM feature with a physical Nano-SIM and an eSIM (currently available on Airtel & JIO Networks only)- The powerful A13 Bionic with 7nm+ (still other manufacturers are struggling with 10nm) handles computational photography. Camera performance with 12MP f/1.8 is top notch. Video recording at 4K@24/30/60fps.- 3GB RAM on iPhone is just a click away to open an APP.- Wi-Fi 802 which can support upto 1GBps so 5G is not re...READ MORE,RAM KIRAN
